  <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 2026-01-01</em></p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This Website uses strictly necessary technologies to operate, deliver content securely,
    and store your preferences locally in your browser.
    Optional categories (Analytics / Marketing) are currently not active and will only apply
    if such technologies are implemented in the future and you explicitly enable them.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What are cookies?</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your browser.
    Similar technologies include local storage, session storage, and other local identifiers
    used to remember preferences or enable essential features.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Categories of technologies we use</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Strictly necessary (always enabled)</h3>
  <p>
    These technologies are required for basic functionality, security, and page delivery.
    They do not require consent under applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security &amp; abuse prevention</strong> (e.g., rate limiting, bot protection, integrity checks)</li>
    <li><strong>Core website operation</strong> (e.g., navigation, UI state required to render the site correctly)</li>
    <li><strong>Preference storage</strong> (e.g., saving your cookie and consent choices locally)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Analytics (future use — currently inactive)</h3>
  <p>
    No analytics technologies are currently active on this Website.
    If implemented in the future, they would only be loaded after your explicit opt-in.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Marketing (future use — currently inactive)</h3>
  <p>
    No marketing or advertising tracking technologies are currently active.
    If implemented in the future, they would only be loaded after your explicit opt-in.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-party advertising or tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We do not operate third-party advertising trackers on this Website.
    Any future change to this approach would be reflected in this Policy and would require
    your explicit consent before activation.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Managing your preferences</h2>
  <p>
    You can review or change your choices at any time via <strong>Cookie Preferences</strong>,
    available from the footer and the consent interface.
    Your preference is stored locally in your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also manage cookies and local storage via your browser settings.
    Please note that disabling strictly necessary technologies may affect site functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Consent preferences &amp; CONSENT REF (local identifier)</h2>

  <p>
    This Website uses a consent interface to record your choices regarding optional categories
    (Analytics / Marketing). Your selection is stored locally in your browser so the Website
    can remember your preference and avoid repeatedly prompting you.
  </p>

  <h3>What happens when you choose “Reject”</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your preference is recorded as <strong>strictly necessary only</strong>.</li>
    <li>No optional categories (Analytics / Marketing) will be enabled, now or in the future,
        unless you explicitly opt in.</li>
    <li>The Website continues to operate normally using strictly necessary technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What happens when you choose “Accept” (or enable optional categories)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your opt-in choice is stored locally in your browser.</li>
    <li>Optional categories are currently inactive. If implemented in the future,
        they would only be activated following your explicit consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is the CONSENT REF?</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>CONSENT REF</strong> is a locally generated reference code created
    in <strong>your own browser</strong>.
    It provides a simple, auditable reference for your current consent state
    on this specific browser or device.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generated locally:</strong> created on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Stored locally:</strong> kept in browser storage to persist your choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Not a cross-site tracker:</strong> not designed to identify you personally
        or track you across other websites.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> you can view or reset it via Cookie Preferences
        or your browser storage controls.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you contact us for support, you may optionally provide your CONSENT REF
    to help us locate the relevant consent state for troubleshooting purposes.
    Providing it is entirely voluntary.
  </p>

  <h3>Resetting or changing your consent</h3>
  <p>
    You can review, change, or reset your preferences at any time via
    <strong>Cookie Preferences</strong>.
    Clearing your browser cookies or local storage will remove your stored consent state,
    and a new CONSENT REF may be generated on your next visit.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Strictly necessary cookies and local identifiers are retained only for as long as
    required for operational and security purposes.
    Preference storage persists until you change your choice or clear your browser storage.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology,
    law, or our practices. The “Last updated” date above indicates when this Policy
    was most recently revised.
  </p>
