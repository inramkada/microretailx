        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>MICRORETAILX LLC</strong> (“MICRORETAILX”, “we”, “us”, “our”) processes personal data
          in connection with this Website. The Website is engineered under a <strong>Zero Data Strategy</strong> by default:
          no accounts are required, optional tracking is disabled by default, and we aim to minimise personal data collection.
        </p>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p><strong>“Website”</strong> means this website and any associated pages, subdomains, interactive elements, code, visuals, outputs, and content.</p>
        <p><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable person, as defined by applicable law.</p>
        <p><strong>“Processing”</strong> means any operation performed on Personal Data (e.g., collection, storage, use, disclosure), as defined by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>Controller and Contact</h2>
        <p>
          This Website is operated and controlled exclusively by <strong>MICRORETAILX LLC</strong>, a Delaware limited liability company.
          For privacy, security, or compliance matters, contact: <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com">legal@microretailx.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Registered Office &amp; Registered Agent (Delaware):</strong><br/>
          Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, United States of America.
        </p>

        <h2>Zero Data Strategy (Default)</h2>
        <p>
          The Website is designed to operate without collecting personal profiles. In practical terms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No visitor accounts are required.</li>
          <li>No behavioural profiling is performed by default.</li>
          <li>No third-party analytics/marketing scripts are loaded by default.</li>
          <li>Optional technologies (analytics/marketing) are activated only after explicit, granular user consent where required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What data may be processed (limited)</h2>
        <p>
          Like most websites, limited technical data may be processed to deliver the Website, maintain security, and prevent abuse.
          This may include (depending on your network and infrastructure): IP address, user-agent string, request timestamps,
          requested URL, referrer headers, and security signals used for rate-limiting or bot mitigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not use this technical processing for advertising, behavioural profiling, or selling personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and consent</h2>
        <p>
          The Website may use strictly necessary cookies (or similar technologies) required to deliver the service, store consent choices,
          and maintain security. Optional cookies (analytics/marketing) are disabled by default and only enabled after consent where required.
          See the Cookies page for details.
        </p>

        <h2>Strict security posture (policy and practice)</h2>
        <p>
          We maintain strict security policies to protect the Website and any limited data processed for security and delivery.
          Our security posture is designed around prevention, detection, and rapid remediation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Secure-by-default configuration:</strong> HTTPS enforcement, modern TLS, and hardened security headers where supported.</li>
          <li><strong>Access control:</strong> least-privilege principles for administrative access and repository operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Change control:</strong> controlled updates and reviews for production-facing code and configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Abuse prevention:</strong> rate limiting, bot mitigation, and security filtering through delivery/security layers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security assessments and audit signals</h2>
        <p>
          We perform regular security assessments (including automated scans and configuration reviews) and aim to maintain strong external security ratings.
          Where appropriate, we may publish or reference summary scan results or scores (e.g., header/TLS checks) and remediate findings promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security scoring tools are indicative and may vary over time; we treat them as continuous-improvement signals rather than absolute guarantees.
        </p>

        <h2>Infrastructure providers (hosting / CDN / security layers)</h2>
        <p>
          The Website may be delivered via third-party infrastructure providers (e.g., static hosting and content delivery/security layers).
          These providers may process limited technical data to deliver content, cache assets, protect against abuse, and maintain availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          We select infrastructure components to support availability and security, and we configure the Website to minimise data exposure.
        </p>

        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal data (if any) only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy (security, integrity, delivery, troubleshooting),
          unless longer retention is required by law. Technical logs handled by infrastructure providers may have their own retention windows.
        </p>

        <h2>International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Because the Website is globally accessible and may use international infrastructure, data may be processed in multiple jurisdictions.
          Where required by applicable law, appropriate safeguards may be implemented for cross-border transfers.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data (e.g., access, correction, deletion, objection, restriction).
          To exercise applicable rights, contact: <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com">legal@microretailx.com</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          The Website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data,
          contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date reflects the most recent version.
          Continued use of the Website after an update means you accept the updated Policy to the extent permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy, security, and compliance notices should be sent to:
          <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com">legal@microretailx.com</a>.
