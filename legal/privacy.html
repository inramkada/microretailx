          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MICRORETAILX LLC</strong> (“MICRORETAILX”, “we”, “us”, “our”) may process
            personal data in connection with this Website. The Website is engineered under a
            <strong>Zero Data Strategy</strong> by default: no accounts are required, no behavioural profiling is performed by default,
            and optional analytics/marketing technologies are disabled unless and until you provide explicit consent where required.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Policy is intended to operate globally and to respect applicable privacy and ePrivacy requirements wherever the Website is accessed.
            Nothing in this Policy limits any mandatory rights you may have under applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2>Controller and Contact</h2>
          <p>
            This Website is operated and controlled exclusively by <strong>MICRORETAILX LLC</strong>, a Delaware limited liability company.
            For privacy, security, or compliance matters, contact:
            <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com">legal@microretailx.com</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Registered Office &amp; Registered Agent (Delaware):</strong><br/>
            Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, United States of America.
          </p>

          <h2>Zero Data Strategy (Default)</h2>
          <p>
            The Website is designed to minimise personal data processing. In practical terms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No accounts</strong> are required to access core Website content.</li>
            <li><strong>No visitor profiling</strong> is performed by default.</li>
            <li><strong>No third-party tracking</strong> is activated by default.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional analytics/marketing</strong> technologies are loaded only after explicit, granular user consent where required.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Data we may process (limited technical data)</h2>
          <p>
            Like most websites, limited technical information may be processed to deliver the Website, maintain security, ensure integrity,
            and prevent abuse. This may include, depending on infrastructure and network conditions: IP address, user-agent string, request timestamps,
            requested URL, referrer headers, and security signals used for rate-limiting, bot mitigation, or troubleshooting.
          </p>
          <p>
            This technical processing is used for <strong>security, availability, integrity, and delivery</strong> purposes and is not used for
            behavioural advertising or selling personal data.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and consent</h2>
          <p>
            The Website may use strictly necessary cookies (or similar technologies) required to deliver core functionality, maintain security,
            and store consent choices. Optional cookies (analytics/marketing) are disabled by default and are only enabled after consent where required.
            See the <a href="cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a> for additional detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consent preferences are stored locally in your browser. A locally generated reference code (referred to as a <strong>CONSENT REF</strong>)
            may be created on your device to reference your current consent state on that specific browser or device. The CONSENT REF is not intended
            to identify you personally or track you across websites.
          </p>

          <h2>Strict security posture (policy and practice)</h2>
          <p>
            We maintain strict security policies and technical safeguards designed to protect the Website and any limited data processed for security and delivery.
            Our approach is based on prevention, detection, and rapid remediation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure-by-default configuration:</strong> HTTPS enforcement, modern TLS, and hardened security headers where supported.</li>
            <li><strong>Access control:</strong> least-privilege administrative access and protected operational workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Change control:</strong> controlled updates, reviews, and rollback capability for production-facing changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Abuse prevention:</strong> rate limiting, bot mitigation, and security filtering through delivery/security layers.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident readiness:</strong> monitoring signals, triage, and remediation workflows designed to reduce exposure and downtime.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Security assessments and external scoring</h2>
          <p>
            We perform periodic security assessments, including automated checks and configuration reviews (e.g., TLS and security header validation),
            and we aim to maintain strong external security ratings where measured by reputable tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Security scores are point-in-time indicators and may vary over time. We treat them as continuous-improvement signals rather than absolute guarantees,
            and we prioritise prompt remediation of materially relevant findings.
          </p>

          <p>
            For transparency purposes, the Website’s security configuration may be independently
            verified using publicly available security analysis tools operated by third parties.
            These tools assess aspects such as transport security, TLS configuration, and HTTP
            security headers at a specific point in time.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time of publication, relevant examples include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Mozilla Observatory</strong> –
              <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/www.microretailx.com"
                 target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/www.microretailx.com
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SecurityHeaders</strong> –
              <a href="https://securityheaders.com/?q=www.microretailx.com&followRedirects=on"
                 target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                https://securityheaders.com/?q=www.microretailx.com&followRedirects=on
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            External security ratings are indicative only, may change over time, and do not
            constitute a warranty of continuous security. We treat such assessments as
            continuous-improvement signals and prioritise remediation of materially relevant
            findings.
          </p>

          <h2>Infrastructure providers (hosting / CDN / security layers)</h2>
          <p>
            The Website may be hosted and delivered via third-party infrastructure providers (including static hosting and delivery/security layers).
            These providers may perform caching, traffic routing, rate limiting, and security filtering to maintain availability and protect against malicious traffic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such providers may process limited technical data for delivery and security. We configure the Website to minimise exposure and do not enable
            optional tracking by default.
          </p>

          <h2>Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain personal data (if any) only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy (security, integrity, delivery,
            troubleshooting, and abuse prevention), unless longer retention is required by law. Infrastructure providers may apply their own retention windows.
          </p>

          <h2>International processing and transfers</h2>
          <p>
            The Website is globally accessible and may involve infrastructure in multiple jurisdictions. Where applicable law requires transfer safeguards,
            we may implement appropriate measures consistent with legal requirements.
          </p><h2>Jurisdiction-neutral notice (global access)</h2>
<p>
  This Website is globally accessible. It is provided as an informational interface and is not intended to constitute a targeted solicitation,
  regulated offering, or promotion in any specific jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  If MICRORETAILX LLC engages in any local project, pilot, collaboration, or operational activity (if any), it will be implemented only through
  appropriate local structures, documentation, and compliance steps under applicable local laws and regulatory requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing in this Policy limits any mandatory rights you may have under applicable data protection or consumer laws in your jurisdiction.
</p>

          <h2>Your rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data (e.g., access, correction, deletion, objection, restriction).

            <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com">legal@microretailx.com</a>
          </p>

          <h2>Children</h2>
          <p>
            The Website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data,
            contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date reflects the most recent version.
