  <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</h1>
  <p>Last Updated: 01/07/2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to XSHADOWS OPS</p>

  <p>These Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms") govern the access and use of the XSHADOWS OPS platform ("the System"), developed and operated by MICRORETAILX LLC, a limited liability company duly incorporated and registered under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States. The company's office is located at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.</p>

  <p>For any legal inquiries or official communications, please contact <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com" style="color: #3498db;">legal@microretailx.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing or using XSHADOWS OPS, the user ("you" or "your") expressly and without reservation agrees to these Terms. If you do not agree with any of the terms herein, you must refrain from using the System. Continued access or use of the System will imply your irrevocable acceptance of these Terms, including any future modifications.</p>

  <p><strong>Important Changes to Terms:</strong> Any significant changes to these Terms will be communicated to users via email circulars sent to the registered address. Users will be informed about the updates, and by continuing to use the System, users consent to the modified Terms. Additionally, important modifications will be visible via a notification banner upon accessing the System.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of the System and Current Status</h2>
  <p>XSHADOWS OPS is an advanced artificial intelligence platform designed to optimize and manage international logistics flows and international trade, enabling supervision, analysis, and decision-making in complex global markets. The System is specifically designed to manage international transactions, optimize supply chains, and facilitate commerce through third-party e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay.</p>

  <p>The System is under continuous development, and as such, may experience limitations or occasional interruptions. By using the System, you accept these inherent risks and assume full responsibility for any consequences arising from the use of the System.</p>

  <p>Given that the System is continuously evolving, functionality and availability may change without prior notice. Continued use of the System after any modification will be considered as acceptance of the new terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Intellectual Property and Exclusive Rights</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC holds all intellectual property rights over all elements of the System, including but not limited to the source code, algorithms, data models, and any associated components. The user does not acquire any rights to these elements and agrees not to perform any acts of decompiling, reverse engineering, modification, or any other unauthorized use.</p>

  <p>This agreement is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), and any violation of the intellectual property and confidentiality provisions may result in severe legal penalties, including a financial penalty of up to â‚¬150,000 for each infringement, as well as potential restitution of damages. The violation of these rights will not only be considered a breach of contract but also a civil offense subject to additional liabilities for damages incurred.</p>

  <h2>4. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure (NDA) - Secured</h2>
  <p>The user agrees to maintain the strictest confidentiality regarding all confidential information accessed through the System, including but not limited to business data, personal data, algorithms, and any other protected information. A breach of this confidentiality obligation may result in legal actions for damages.</p>

  <p>This confidentiality agreement is binding and cannot be modified or contested. The user agrees that any violation of these provisions will result in severe legal consequences, including liability for damages. Parties shall not disclose confidential information under any circumstances, even after termination of this agreement, unless explicit written consent is obtained from MICRORETAILX LLC.</p>

  <p>This confidentiality clause is untouchable and shall be considered fully valid in all circumstances.</p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability - Secured</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of the results obtained through XSHADOWS OPS. The use of the System is at the user's own risk, and MICRORETAILX LLC is exempt from all liability for direct, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages arising from errors in the System, technical failures, data losses, or service interruptions.</p>

  <p>The user expressly waives any right to make claims for damages related to the use of XSHADOWS OPS, even if such damages were foreseeable. Any attempt to challenge the validity of this waiver shall be considered null and unenforceable. MICRORETAILX LLC does not take responsibility for damages that result from incorrect use of the System or errors in the results produced.</p>

  <h2>6. Legal Compliance and Multijurisdictional Regulation - Secured with Jurisdiction in Barcelona</h2>
  <p>The user agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their country of residence and those applicable to their use of the System. XSHADOWS OPS operates under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, and complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other international regulations.</p>

  <p>However, the user and MICRORETAILX LLC agree that the jurisdiction for resolving any dispute related to these Terms will be exclusively in the courts of Barcelona, Spain, if the dispute involves a user residing in Spain. For any other jurisdiction not involving residents in Spain, the exclusive jurisdiction will be Delaware, USA, as detailed in clause 10.</p>

  <p>This agreement for jurisdiction in Barcelona is unappealable and cannot be contested, nor altered by any other party or jurisdiction, even if the user resides outside Spain.</p>

  <h2>7. Modification of Service and System</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue XSHADOWS OPS, either in full or in part, at any time and for any reason, without prior notice. Any modification will be governed by the terms set forth in this document. Continued use of the System after any modification will be considered as acceptance of the new terms. Significant changes to the System or its availability will be notified to users via email.</p>

  <h2>8. Exemption of Liability for Interruptions or System Failures</h2>
  <p>The user acknowledges that XSHADOWS OPS is a platform under continuous development, and therefore the availability of the service may be affected by interruptions or system failures. MICRORETAILX LLC does not guarantee that access will be continuous, uninterrupted, or error-free. The user assumes full responsibility for any incidents arising from these issues and waives any claims in case they occur.</p>

  <h2>9. Modification of Terms</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Modifications will take effect immediately upon being posted on the corresponding website. The user is responsible for periodically reviewing these Terms, and continued use of the System after any change will imply acceptance of the new terms. Significant changes to the Terms will be communicated to users via email circulars.</p>

  <h2>10. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law - Secured with Barcelona</h2>
  <p>These Terms will be governed and interpreted exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, but, in the case of users residing in Spain, the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute will be in the courts of Barcelona, Spain. Any dispute arising from these Terms related to residents in Spain will be resolved solely in the courts of Barcelona, with full validity and applicability of Spanish law. The user expressly consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts, waiving any other jurisdiction that may apply based on their residence or other reasons.</p>

  <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to first attempt to resolve the conflict amicably through mediation or arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved through these methods, the exclusive jurisdiction for residents in Spain will be in the courts of Barcelona, Spain, as established in clause 10.</p>

  <h2>12. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>For inquiries or claims, you can contact MICRORETAILX LLC via email at: <a href="mailto:legal@microretailx.com" style="color: #3498db;">legal@microretailx.com</a></p>

  <h2>13. Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Europe</h2>
  <p>In the event that the user is located within the European Union or in countries adhering to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), MICRORETAILX LLC ensures strict compliance with the privacy and data protection regulations established by said regulation. The user expressly consents to their personal data being processed in accordance with applicable EU legislation.</p>

  <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, cyberattacks, governmental actions, or other unforeseen events that affect the operation of XSHADOWS OPS.</p>
