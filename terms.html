      <li>August 23, 2025 – Initial publication with comprehensive legal framework for international operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Framework and Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This document establishes the conditions governing access and use of the <strong>XSHADOWS OPS</strong> 
      technology platform, developed and operated by MICRORETAILX LLC.
    </p>
    
    <div class="important-notice">
      <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #856404;">Important Considerations</h4>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This service is designed for international commercial operations. 
      Given the cross-border nature of digital operations, we have developed a regulatory framework 
      that ensures legal certainty across multiple jurisdictions, complying with principles of 
      <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>proportionality</strong>, and <strong>proactive accountability</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Jurisdictions and Regulatory Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Our legal framework integrates compliance with European data protection regulations (GDPR), 
      California privacy laws (CCPA), and internationally recognized principles for artificial intelligence. 
      This approach ensures operational resilience in both civil law and common law jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      Dispute resolution mechanisms are established in the <strong>Courts of Barcelona</strong> 
      and the <strong>State of Delaware</strong>, jurisdictions selected for their recognized legal certainty 
      and enforceability in commercial and technology disputes.
    </p>

  </section>

  <h2>1. Definitions and Interpretation</h2>
  <p>For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>"Platform" or "System"</strong>: Technology infrastructure comprising proprietary software architecture, 
    artificial intelligence modules, APIs, database systems, cloud computing services, and real-time analytics engines known as XSHADOWS OPS.</li>
    
    <li><strong>"Qualified User"</strong>: Natural person of legal age with full legal capacity, 
    or legal entity duly incorporated under its national law, accessing the System for commercial, professional, or enterprise purposes.</li>
    
    <li><strong>"Data Processing"</strong>: Any operation performed on personal data, 
    including collection, recording, organization, storage, consultation, use, disclosure, or destruction.</li>
    
    <li><strong>"Algorithmic Output"</strong>: Any recommendation, prediction, or decision-support information 
    generated through machine learning models or AI technologies. Such outputs are inherently probabilistic 
    and shall not be construed as deterministic instructions.</li>
    
    <li><strong>"Force Majeure Event"</strong>: Any act, event, or circumstance beyond the reasonable control 
    of either Party, including natural disasters, acts of war, cyberattacks, regulatory changes, or global pandemics.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In case of ambiguity, the English version of these Terms shall prevail. 
  Headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation.</p>

  <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing, installing, or utilizing the System in any manner, the User represents and warrants 
  that they possess full legal capacity to enter into binding contractual obligations and confirms complete, 
  informed, and irrevocable acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. This acceptance constitutes a legally 
  binding electronic signature. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease use of the System.</p>

  <h2>3. System Description</h2>
  <p>XSHADOWS OPS is a proprietary digital system under development by MICRORETAILX LLC, designed to integrate 
  AI-powered decision-support engines, supply chain analytics, and risk-adjusted forecasting tools. 
  Upon operational launch, it will serve enterprise-grade environments handling international logistics, 
  trade documentation, compliance automation, and market intelligence workflows.</p>
  
  <p><em>Note: While the platform remains under active development, these terms pre-establish the governance 
  and operational expectations upon launch.</em></p>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All components of the System constitute proprietary intellectual property protected under applicable 
  copyright, patent, and trademark laws. All intellectual and industrial property rights associated 
  with the System are the exclusive property of MICRORETAILX LLC. Any unauthorized copying, reverse engineering, 
  or derivative use is prohibited and may result in legal action.</p>
  
  <p><em>Note: The parties may modify this clause regarding derivative works through bilateral agreement 
  executed digitally, provided such modification does not materially compromise the Company's core intellectual property rights.</em></p>

  <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>All Users agree to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any non-public or proprietary information 
  related to the System. This obligation survives termination of access for 5 years post-termination 
  and is enforceable through litigation. Breach may result in immediate suspension and legal recourse.</p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>The System is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Company's total liability for any claims arising from or related to these Terms or the System shall not exceed the greater of (i) $1,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by User to Company in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>
  
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, regardless of the theory of liability and even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
  
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

  <h2>7. Legal Compliance Framework</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC operates under applicable data protection and privacy laws, including but not limited to GDPR for EU users and CCPA for California residents. The Company implements industry-standard security measures and maintains documented policies for data handling, though specific compliance certifications may vary and are available upon request.</p>
  
  <p>All AI systems are designed in accordance with emerging industry standards and ethical guidelines, though the regulatory landscape continues to evolve.</p>

  <h2>8. Service Availability and Termination</h2>
  <p>MICRORETAILX LLC provides 99.9% monthly uptime guarantee with planned maintenance maximum 4 hours monthly 
  (7-day notice) and emergency maintenance maximum 2 hours without prior notice.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Termination by Company:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to the System immediately, 
  without prior notice, if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You breach any material provision of these Terms</li>
    <li>Your account shows signs of unauthorized access or security compromise</li>
    <li>Your usage pattern indicates potential fraud, abuse, or violation of applicable laws</li>
    <li>You fail to pay applicable fees after 30-day notice (for paid services)</li>
    <li>Legal or regulatory requirements mandate suspension</li>
    <li>Your activities pose a security risk to other users or our infrastructure</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Appeal Process:</strong> Users who dispute a suspension or termination may submit an appeal 
  to <a href="mailto:appeals@microretailx.com">appeals@microretailx.com</a> within 15 days of notification. 
  Appeals must include supporting evidence and a detailed explanation. We will review appeals within 5 business days 
  and provide a written response. During the appeal process, suspended accounts remain inaccessible.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Termination by User:</strong> You may terminate your account at any time by contacting our support team. 
  Upon termination, your access will cease within 24 hours, though certain data retention obligations may apply.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted to you will cease immediately. 
  Sections relating to intellectual property, confidentiality, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution shall survive termination.</p>

  <h2>9. Account Security and User Obligations</h2>
  <p>Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials and for all activities 
  that occur under their account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Prohibited Activities:</strong> Users may not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the System or other users' accounts</li>
    <li>Use the System for illegal activities or to violate third-party rights</li>
    <li>Distribute malware, spam, or engage in any form of network abuse</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract source code</li>
    <li>Resell, redistribute, or provide commercial access to the System without authorization</li>
    <li>Use automated tools to scrape or harvest data beyond reasonable API limits</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Enforcement and Consequences:</strong> Violations of these obligations may result in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spam/Abuse:</strong> Immediate account suspension + reporting to relevant authorities and anti-spam organizations</li>
    <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Permanent account termination + law enforcement notification</li>
    <li><strong>Malware Distribution:</strong> Immediate termination + coordination with cybersecurity agencies</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial Violations:</strong> Account suspension + potential legal action for damages</li>
    <li><strong>API Abuse:</strong> Rate limiting escalation + temporary to permanent API access revocation</li>
    <li><strong>Data Scraping:</strong> IP blocking + cease and desist notification + potential litigation</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>We reserve the right to preserve and disclose account information when required by law or when we believe 
  in good faith that preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>15. AI-Based Decision Support and Limitations</h2>
  <p>The System may provide outputs generated through artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. 
  These outputs are for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for business, 
  legal, financial, or other decisions. Users are responsible for independently verifying any AI-generated recommendations.</p>
  
  <p>While we strive to minimize bias in our AI systems, we cannot guarantee that AI outputs will be free from 
  bias or error. The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, 
  or suitability of AI-generated content for any particular purpose.</p>
  
  <p>Current AI modules are designed in accordance with OECD principles and are expected to fall within "Limited Risk" 
  under the forthcoming EU AI Act classifications, subject to final audit and registration.</p>

  <h2>16. Assignment and Licensing</h2>
  <p>The User may not assign, delegate, or transfer any rights under these Terms without prior written consent. 
  The Company may assign its rights under these Terms in the context of a merger, acquisition, or restructuring.</p>
