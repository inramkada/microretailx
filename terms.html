    <h2>Statement of Legal Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      This document has been structured in accordance with the legal drafting standards typically applied in complex international digital infrastructure projects. Its composition reflects an anticipatory legal architecture tailored to environments characterized by regulatory volatility, transnational exposure, and technological opacity.
    </p>

    <h3>Multijurisdictional Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      The Terms integrate a coherent compliance framework encompassing the <strong>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>, the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>, and internationally recognized ethical principles for artificial intelligence, including the <em>OECD AI Principles</em> and the <em>UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI</em>. This synthesis is designed to ensure operational resilience across both civil law and common law jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategic Jurisdictional Anchoring</h3>
    <p>
      Dispute resolution mechanisms are anchored in the <strong>Courts of Barcelona</strong> and the <strong>State of Delaware</strong>, reflecting a deliberate selection of jurisdictions renowned for legal certainty and enforceability in commercial and technology-driven disputes. The governing law provisions are drafted to mitigate forum shopping and procedural inefficiencies.
    </p>

    <h3>Clarity of Legal Intent</h3>
    <p>
      While employing terminology aligned with enterprise-grade legal frameworks, the document preserves accessibility for non-legal stakeholders. This dual readability approach is characteristic of strategic legal instruments meant to guide executive-level decision-making while maintaining enforceability under scrutiny.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Governance and Liability Shielding</h3>
    <p>
      A clear distinction is established between <strong>AI-generated outputs</strong> and human decision-making responsibilities. The allocation of liability in relation to algorithmic interpretation is mapped via a dedicated <strong>Responsibility Matrix</strong>, serving as an internal risk mitigation tool and an external demonstration of due diligence.
    </p>

    <h3>Cybersecurity and Operational Continuity</h3>
    <p>
      The Terms embed forward-looking provisions addressing cybersecurity threats, unauthorized third-party integrations, and force majeure events related to digital continuity. These are structured to align with best practices in <em>technology risk governance</em> and to withstand forensic scrutiny in case of breach, loss, or regulatory inquiry.
    </p>

    <h3>Traceability and Change Control</h3>
    <p>
      Version control and change tracking protocols are codified to facilitate auditability and provide historical clarity. This approach aligns with institutional investor requirements and the expectations of supervisory authorities in highly regulated sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>This legal construct is intended not merely to ensure compliance, but to function as a defensive legal perimeter—capable of withstanding litigation, regulatory inspection, and investor due diligence across multiple jurisdictions and operational regimes.</em>
    </p>

   <p><strong>— Structured to meet the demands of cross-border compliance, regulatory scrutiny, and institutional-grade governance.</strong></p>
