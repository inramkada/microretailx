      <h1>Terms and Conditions of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Version:</strong> 3.0 | <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/08/2025</p>
  <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>01/07/2025 – Initial publication of Terms and Conditions</li>
    <li>05/07/2025 – Legal and editorial enhancements, clause consistency, AI clarification, privacy expansion</li>
    <li>01/08/2025 – Enterprise legal architecture implementation, EU AI Act compliance, cross-border tax framework</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>PREAMBLE AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</h2>
    <p>
      This legal instrument constitutes a comprehensive regulatory framework governing access, utilization, and commercial exploitation of the technological platform denominated <strong>XSHADOWS OPS</strong>, developed and operated by MICRORETAILX LLC (hereinafter, "the Company").
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>WHEREAS</strong> the transnational nature of digital operations demands normative design ensuring legal certainty across multiple jurisdictions; <strong>WHEREAS</strong> the incorporation of artificial intelligence systems presents unprecedented regulatory challenges requiring anticipatory governance frameworks; <strong>WHEREAS</strong> personal data protection constitutes a fundamental right recognized under Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company hereby establishes this contractual regime under the principles of <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>proportionality</strong>, and <strong>proactive accountability</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Statement of Legal Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      This document has been structured in accordance with the legal drafting standards typically applied in complex international digital infrastructure projects. Its composition reflects an anticipatory legal architecture tailored to environments characterized by regulatory volatility, transnational exposure, and technological opacity.
    </p>

    <h3>Multijurisdictional Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      The Terms integrate a coherent compliance framework encompassing the <strong>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>, the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>, and internationally recognized ethical principles for artificial intelligence, including the <em>OECD AI Principles</em> and the <em>UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI</em>. This synthesis is designed to ensure operational resilience across both civil law and common law jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategic Jurisdictional Anchoring</h3>
    <p>
      Dispute resolution mechanisms are anchored in the <strong>Courts of Barcelona</strong> and the <strong>State of Delaware</strong>, reflecting a deliberate selection of jurisdictions renowned for legal certainty and enforceability in commercial and technology-driven disputes. The governing law provisions are drafted to mitigate forum shopping and procedural inefficiencies.
    </p>

    <h3>Cross-Border Tax and Economic Substance Framework</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure operational clarity and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions, the Company declares: <strong>Primary Business Operations</strong> - All core business functions, including strategic decision-making, risk management, and technology development, are conducted exclusively from the Company's registered offices in Delaware, United States. <strong>Service Delivery Model</strong> - All Platform services are designed, managed, and delivered from United States infrastructure, with EU data processing conducted solely for compliance purposes under adequate jurisdiction frameworks.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Governance and Liability Shielding</h3>
    <p>
      A clear distinction is established between <strong>AI-generated outputs</strong> and human decision-making responsibilities. The allocation of liability in relation to algorithmic interpretation is mapped via a dedicated <strong>Responsibility Matrix</strong>, serving as an internal risk mitigation tool and an external demonstration of due diligence. The Company acknowledges the applicability of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU AI Act) with current systems classified as <strong>"Limited Risk"</strong> under Article 50.
    </p>

    <h3>Cybersecurity and Operational Continuity</h3>
    <p>
      The Terms embed forward-looking provisions addressing cybersecurity threats, unauthorized third-party integrations, and force majeure events related to digital continuity. The Company maintains <strong>ISO 27001:2013</strong> certified information security management system and <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong> compliance for security, availability, and confidentiality.
    </p>

    <h3>Traceability and Change Control</h3>
    <p>
      Version control and change tracking protocols are codified to facilitate auditability and provide historical clarity. This approach aligns with institutional investor requirements and the expectations of supervisory authorities in highly regulated sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>This legal construct is intended not merely to ensure compliance, but to function as a defensive legal perimeter—capable of withstanding litigation, regulatory inspection, and investor due diligence across multiple jurisdictions and operational regimes.</em>
    </p>

   <p><strong>— Structured to meet the demands of cross-border compliance, regulatory scrutiny, and institutional-grade governance.</strong></p>
